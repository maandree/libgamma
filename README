libgamma is a library that aims to abstract away the
display server when adjusting the color curves
for monitors via gamma ramps.

The principal goal of libgamma is to provide abstraction
now that we are entering a world of multiple display
servers and to reduce code duplication both within and
between software like redshift and blueshift.
