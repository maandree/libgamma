NAME
	libgamma - Display server abstraction layer for gamma ramps

DESCRIPTION
	libgamma is a library that aims to abstract away the
	display server when adjusting the colour curves for
	monitors via gamma ramps.

RATIONALE
	The principal goal of libgamma is to provide abstraction
	now that we are entering a world of multiple display
	servers and to reduce code duplication both within and
	between software like redshift(1) and blueshift(1).

SEE ALSO
	blueshift(1), xgamma(1), xrandr(1), pylibgamma, jlibgamma,
	libgammamm
