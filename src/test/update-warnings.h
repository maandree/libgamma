/*
 * This file testes whether the program is out of date
 * when it is compiled. This is done by checking for newer
 * values of constants that tells us how much there is of
 * different things for which we may want to create
 * descriptions or otherwise handle especially.
 * 
 * To get the current value of for example `LIBGAMMA_ERROR_MIN`
 * simply run the command
 * 
 *     cpp <<EOF | tail -n 1
 *     #include <libgamma.h>
 *     LIBGAMMA_ERROR_MIN
 *     EOF
 *
 * However, we only do this for if GCC is used to
 * compile the program because the #warning CPP
 * directive is a GCC extension. If you are not
 * using GNU you may want to find another way to
 * accomplish this.
